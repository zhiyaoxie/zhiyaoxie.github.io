Work Experience
======
* **Part-time EDA Administrator, Duke University**, 2020-2022
  * Purchasing and providing help on all EDA tools for teaching and research purposes at Duke University.

* **Research Intern, Arm**, June 2020 – Nov 2020
  * Advisor: Xiaoqing Xu, Shidhartha Das, Brian Cline
  * Developed the first runtime on-chip power monitor that simultaneously achieves per-cycle resolution and less than 1% area overhead without compromising accuracy.
  * The overall framework automatically generates training data, develops the model, and constructs the power monitor with minimum designer interference.
  * It is verified on multiple industry-standard CPU cores including ARM Neoverse N1 and Cortex-A77. 

* **Software Engineer Intern, Synopsys**, May 2019 – Aug 2019
  * Advisor: Anand Rajaram, Min Pan, Aiqun Cao
  * Developed a light-weighted linear model to estimate transition violation on the clock tree.
  * The model is integrated into IC Compiler II and proves to improve clock tree quality by guiding CTS with early feedback.
  
* **Research Intern, Nvidia**, Sep 2018 – Dec 2018
  * Advisor: Haoxing (Mark) Ren, Brucek Khailany
  * Developed a customized CNN model for IR drop prediction. By incorporating switching time into power
map features, this is the first design-independent estimator for both vector-based and vectorless IR drop.
  * After integrating it into their in-house IR mitigation flow, hotspots in latest designs are reduced by 30%.

* **Software Engineer Intern, Cadence**, June 2018 – Aug 2018
  * Advisor: Jie (Jack) Chen, Weibin Ding
  * Developed deep neural network models for very early routability prediction even before the placement
optimization. This is an early effort on routability estimation in the EDA industry.
