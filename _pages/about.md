Assistant Professor    
*Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)*

Zhiyao Xie is an Assistant Professor in the ECE Department at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) since 2022. His research focuses on AI-assisted electronic design automation (EDA) and chip design methodologies. He completed his Ph.D. at Duke University in 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Yiran Chen and Prof. Hai (Helen) Li, following his B.Eng from CityU HK in 2017 with a full scholarship & first-class honours. During his Ph.D. studies, Zhiyao also worked as a research intern at leading IC and EDA companies, including NVIDIA, Arm, Cadence, and Synopsys, where he was fortunate to work with Dr. Haoxing Ren, Dr. Brucek Khailany, Dr. Xiaoqing Xu, Dr. Shidhartha Das, and Prof. Jiang Hu.    

Zhiyao has received multiple prestigious awards, including the RGC HK Early Career Award 2023 (7 out of 525 HK faculty), ACM Outstanding Dissertation Award in EDA 2023 (1 awardee worldwide per year), EDAA Outstanding Dissertation Award 2023 (4 awardees worldwide per year), MICRO 2021 Best Paper Award (1st-author, 1 out of 430), ASP-DAC 2023 Best Paper Award (2 out of 328), WAIC Yufan Award (Brilliant Star) 2023, ACM SIGDA SRF 2022 Best Research Poster Award, and 4 more best paper nominations. He also received Faculty Teaching Excellence Appreciation Award 2023/24 for his computer architecture course. He has published 50+ refereed papers, more than half in top EDA venues (DAC, ICCAD, IEEE TCAD) and some others in top computer architecture venues (MICRO, ISCA, HPCA).   

He has served as the TPC Member/TPC Track Chair/Student Forum Chair of all major EDA conferences: DAC, ICCAD, DATE, ASPDAC, MLCAD, ICLAD, ISEDA, and GLSVLSI. He served as the reviewer of 10+ IEEE/ACM journals. He also served as the Chair of IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation (CEDA) Hong Kong Chapter.

Selected Research Works   
======
My lab explores ground-breaking data-driven EDA/AI methods to deliver better VLSI circuit design with lower NRE cost, less human effort, and shorter turnaround time. We view *circuit* as a special data type, then explore and utilize its unique data properties. We are especially experienced in 1) early-stage circuit *power* evaluation, 2) early-stage circuit *timing* evaluation, 3) automated *circuit generation*, and 4) CPU prefetcher design:
