Zhiyao Xie is an Assistant Professor in the ECE Department at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where he joined in 2022. He completed his Ph.D. at Duke University in 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Yiran Chen and Prof. Hai (Helen) Li, following his B.Eng from CityU HK in 2017 on a full scholarship. During his Ph.D. studies, Zhiyao also worked as a research intern at leading IC design and electronic design automation (EDA) companies such as Nvidia, Arm, Cadence, and Synopsys. His research interests span cross-disciplinary topics in electronic design automation, VLSI design, computer architecture, and machine learning, with a particular focus on machine learning for hardware design. Zhiyao has received multiple prestigious awards, including the MICRO 2021 Best Paper Award, ACM Outstanding Dissertation Award in EDA 2023 (one awardee every year), EDAA Outstanding Dissertation Award 2023, ACM SIGDA SRF 2022 Best Research Poster Award, ASP-DAC 2023 Best Paper Award, UGC/RGC Early Career Award 2023, etc. Now he also serves as the Seminar Chair of IEEE CEDA Hong Kong.

    * No need to waste time writing a long email, just drop me your CV with grade.

Why Joining Us?
======

* Our research topics are highly cross-disciplinary. You are expected to master deep knowledge on programming, data structure and algorithm, machine learning, EDA, VLSI design, etc. after you graduate. I believe many of these directions are in a very high demand in job market nowadays.  

* Our lab has a small number of students with enough research resources. Therefore, you can get hands-on supervision from the advisor during your Ph.D. study. This could be very helpful when starting your research.  

* HKUST is undoubtedly a top Asian university in science and engineering. Its world ranking was #34 in QS 2022, and #24 in QS 2022 Engineering & Technology.
