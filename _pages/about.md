Zhiyao Xie joined the ECE Department of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) as an Assistant Professor since 2022. He received B.Eng from CityU HK in 2017 and Ph.D. from Duke University in 2022, supervised by Prof. Yiran Chen and Prof. Hai (Helen) Li. He also worked as a research intern in leading semiconductor and electronic design automation (EDA) companies including Nvidia, Arm, Cadence, and Synopsys. His research interests include cross-disciplinary topics in electronic design automation, VLSI design, computer architecture, and machine learning. He is especially experienced in machine learning for hardware design. He has received MICRO 2021 Best Paper Award, ACM SIGDA Best Research Poster Award in 2022, two ASP-DAC 2023 Best Paper Nominations, etc. Now he also serves as the Publicity Chair of IEEE CEDA Hong Kong. 


Selected Projects
======

*  **Early-Stage Fast Routability Prediction**
>> I proposed the first systematic study on CNN-based routability prediction. It attracts wide attention in ML for EDA and becomes a common baseline. Some feature-extraction and model-design principles first proposed by us are still widely adopted. Published in ICCAD'18, DATE'19, and also presented in Nvidia GTC'18 and TAU'19. I collaborate with Cadence to validate routability estimation during my internship. Our follow-up works are published in ICCAD’21, DAC’22, addressing the ML model design and data availability challenges in routability prediction. I also write a book chapter on this topic. 



Ph.D. Student Recruitment
======
**I am looking for motivated students to join my lab as Ph.D. students in HKUST in 2023.** Do not hesitate to [email](mailto:eezhiyao@ust.hk) me (eezhiyao@ust.hk) if you are interested. (Excuse me for not being able to reply every email...)

* **Qualifications**: It is preferred if the applicant has a good background in any of these fields: machine learning, VLSI design, computer engineering, algorithm design, microelectronics, etc. Strong programming ability or machine learning background is a huge plus. Good grade is a big plus.

* **Basic Program Information**: HKUST ranked No.34 in QS World University Rankings 2022. The Ph.D. program duration is 3-4 years, depending on whether the student holds a relevant research master's degree. The basic monthly salary of Ph.D. students is about HKD 18K. Learn more about the program at this [link](https://prog-crs.ust.hk/pgprog/2022-23/mphil-phd-ece).

* **Research Topics**: I have multiple research topics on cutting-edge machine learning for EDA techniques. Detailed instructions will be provided when starting your research. 

* **HKFPS**: Learn about HK PhD Fellowship Scheme if you have a strong resume.

* If you are a HKUST undergraduate EE/CS/math student and want to learn more about research assistant or Ph.D. positions, feel free to contact me. A good grade is a big plus. 

Why Joining Us?
======

* Our research topics are highly cross-disciplinary. You are expected to master deep knowledge on algorithm/programming, machine learning, EDA, VLSI design, etc after you graduate. I believe all these directions are in high demand in job market nowadays.  

* Our lab has a small number of students with enough research resources. Therefore, you can get hands-on supervision from the advisor during your Ph.D. study. This could be very helpful when starting your research.  

Post-Doc Recruitment
======
* We are also looking for Post-Docs in computer architecture/circuit design/VLSI/EDA directions, especially AI-chip development. We need you got Ph.D. from Universities in QS Top 100 or in Hong Kong. Do not hesitate to contact me for more information!
