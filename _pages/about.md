I will join the ECE Department of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) as an Assistant Professor in early 2022. I received my Ph.D. degree from ECE Department of Duke University, advised by [Prof. Yiran Chen](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/yiran-chen) and [Prof. Hai (Helen) Li](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/hai-helen-li). My research interests include electronic design automation, VLSI design, machine learning, and computer architecture. I am especially professional in machine learning in design automation. I am the receip

Ph.D. student recruitment
======
I am now eagerly looking for motivated students to join my lab as Ph.D. students in HKUST. Do not hesitate to [email](zhiyao.xie@duke.edu) me (zhiyao.xie@duke.edu) if you are interested. 

It is preferred if the application has strong background on any of these fields: VLSI design, computer engineering, machine learning, algorithm design, applied math, programming, etc. Also, I do realize this is not common for undergraduate studetns. As long as you are diligent and intelligent, you are welcomed to contact me.  

Basic Information about the Ph.D. program: The program duration is 3-4 years, depending on whether the student holds a relevant research master's degree. The monthly salary of Ph.D. HKUST ranked No.34 in QS World University Rankings 2022. The monthly salary of Ph.D. students is HKD 15,000-20,000. Learn more about the program at this [link](https://prog-crs.ust.hk/pgprog/2022-23/mphil-phd-ece).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
