I will join the ECE Department of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) as an Assistant Professor in early 2022. I received my Ph.D. degree from ECE Department of Duke University, advised by [Prof. Yiran Chen](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/yiran-chen) and [Prof. Hai (Helen) Li](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/hai-helen-li). My research interests include electronic design automation, VLSI design, machine learning, and computer architecture. I am especially professional in machine learning in design automation. I am the recipient of MICRO 2021 Best Paper Award.
