Why Joining Us?
======

* Our research topics are highly cross-disciplinary. You are expected to master deep knowledge on programming, data structure and algorithm, machine learning, EDA, VLSI design, etc. after you graduate. I believe many of these directions are in a very high demand in job market nowadays.  

* Our lab has a small number of students with enough research resources. Therefore, you can get hands-on supervision from the advisor during your Ph.D. study. This could be very helpful when starting your research.  

* HKUST is undoubtedly a top Asian university in science and engineering. Its world ranking was #34 in QS 2022, and #24 in QS 2022 Engineering & Technology.
