I joined the ECE Department of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) as an Assistant Professor since 2022. I received my Ph.D. degree from ECE Department of Duke University in 2022, advised by [Prof. Yiran Chen](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/yiran-chen) and [Prof. Hai (Helen) Li](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/hai-helen-li). My research interests include cross-disciplinary topics in electronic design automation, VLSI design, computer architecture, and machine learning. I am especially experienced in machine learning for hardware design. I am the recipient of MICRO 2021 Best Paper Award.

Ph.D. Student Recruitment
======
**I am looking for motivated students to join my lab as Ph.D. students in HKUST in 2023.** Do not hesitate to [email](mailto:eezhiyao@ust.hk) me (eezhiyao@ust.hk) if you are interested. (Excuse me for not being able to reply every email...)

* **Qualifications**: It is preferred if the applicant has a good background in any of these fields: machine learning, VLSI design, computer engineering, algorithm design, microelectronics, etc. Strong programming ability or machine learning background is a huge plus. Good grade is a big plus.

* **Basic Program Information**: HKUST ranked No.34 in QS World University Rankings 2022. The Ph.D. program duration is 3-4 years, depending on whether the student holds a relevant research master's degree. The basic monthly salary of Ph.D. students is about HKD 18K. Learn more about the program at this [link](https://prog-crs.ust.hk/pgprog/2022-23/mphil-phd-ece).

* **Research Topics**: I have multiple research topics on cutting-edge machine learning for EDA techniques. Detailed instructions will be provided when starting your research. 

* **HKFPS**: Learn about HK PhD Fellowship Scheme if you have a strong resume.

* If you are a HKUST undergraduate EE/CS/math student and want to learn more about research assistant or Ph.D. positions, feel free to contact me. A good grade is a big plus. 

Why Joining Us?
======

* Our research topics are highly cross-disciplinary. You are expected to master deep knowledge on algorithm/programming, machine learning, EDA, VLSI design, etc after you graduate. I believe all these directions are in high demand in job market nowadays.  

* Our lab has a small number of students with enough research resources. Therefore, you can get hands-on supervision from the advisor during your Ph.D. study. This could be very helpful when starting your research.  

Post-Doc Recruitment
======
* We are also looking for Post-Docs in computer architecture/circuit design/VLSI/EDA directions, especially AI-chip development. We need you got Ph.D. from Universities in QS Top 100 or in Hong Kong. Do not hesitate to contact me for more information!
